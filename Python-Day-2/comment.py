 #Calculating sum of two numbers

# First Number
num1 = 20
# Second Number
num2 = 30
# Calculating Sum of both numbers
sum = num1 + num2
#Printing the sum of numbers
print(sum)  

#Calculating the area of Circle

#Importing the constant value to pi variable
pi=3.14
#Radius for area of circle
r=3
#Now applying the formula of area of circle
area_of_circle=pi*r*r
