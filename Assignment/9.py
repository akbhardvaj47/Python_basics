word = 'Programming'
# Printing first character of word
first_char=word[0]
# print(word[0])
# Print the last character of the string.
last_char=word[-1]
# print(word[-1])
# Print the length of the string.
length=len(word)

print('First character is ' +first_char)
print('Last character is ' +last_char)
print('Length of the Word is {}'.format(length))
