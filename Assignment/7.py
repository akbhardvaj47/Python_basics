Simple Concatenation
Task: Create two variables, first_name and last_name. Assign your first name to
first_name and your last name to last_name. Then, concatenate these two
variables to form a full name and print it. Add a space between the first name and
last name.
Example Code:
first_name = "Akash"
last_name = "Amit"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)

# Creating two variables
first_name = 'Amit '
last_name = 'Bhardwaj'
full_name=first_name+last_name
print(f"{first_name}{last_name}")
print(full_name)
